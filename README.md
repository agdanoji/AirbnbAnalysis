# Airbnb Data Analysis Project 
###CSE 544 Probability and statistics for data science 
Our project aims to analyze the factors that would enable Airbnb hosts to profit the most from their listings by increasing the chances of their listings getting booked. 
It would also help the Airbnb guests to make wise decisions regarding which listings to book and when to book them. 
The chief dataset used for this project was the Airbnb dataset for New York City (NYC) from 2015-17. 
Crime and Population datasets of NYC were also referred to for certain hypotheses. 
Besides this, online websites were used to get the number of subway stations and best family neighbourhoods in NYC.
Overall, we cover 5 broad questions that we wish to answer and the range of techniques covered to answer these questions include: 
Parametric and Non-parametric inference, Hypothesis Testing, Linear Regression, Time-series analysis and Bayesian Inference.
